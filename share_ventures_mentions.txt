Innovations from biotechnology to manufacturing pave the way for improving our bodies on a personal level. We explore and develop technologies that tap into the power of human potential, unleashing performance solutions designed to fuel healthy, active lifestyles.













The growing economic divide highlights inefficiencies in wealth accumulation despite new business opportunities arising daily. We build platforms and services that enable those on the forefront of the new economy.

Why can’t entrepreneurship be more inclusive?
We believe exceptional work demands exceptional talent. Our methodology allows for the de-risking of early stage company building and the subsequent ability to unlock diverse, experienced talent. We love working with top engineers, designers, product managers, marketers, and operators with varied backgrounds and perspectives.













Why can’t the entrepreneurial process be more collaborative?
We’ve worked with world-class businesses and influential people to launch products, companies, and even innovation platforms.













Why can’t the entrepreneurial process be more efficient?
The venture studio model is unique in the ability to generate “Sustainable Innovation”, our term for the ability to create efficiencies and de-risk across multiple early-stage ventures. We’ve built systems and methodologies that act as force multipliers - creating, capturing, and reusing the value created in all of our processes.













Why can’t entrepreneurship have a higher success rate?
We are smart enough to know we have a lot to learn. We build systems to capture and harness data, using it as a guiding force in our pursuit to discover, ideate, test, and build.

Share Ventures, an LA-based studio for company creation, is MoviePass co-founder Hamet Watt’s next act




			Jonathan Shieber		

@jshieber
 / 
						3 years		







Nearly eight years ago, Hamet Watt and Stacy Spikes launched MoviePass, the subscription-based movie ticketing service that captured the minds and dollars of investors and brought thousands of cinephiles a too-good-to-be-true deal for all-you-can watch movie passes.
Watt, who came to MoviePass as an entrepreneur in residence at True Ventures, previously founded the brand and product placement startup NextMedium and also spent time as a board partner at Upfront Ventures. Now, the serial entrepreneur and startup investor is combining his two career paths under the auspices of Share Ventures.
“It’s what I feel like I’ve been put here to do,” says Watt. “I love solving problems with design and entrepreneurship. I wasn’t fully scratching the itch as an investor by itself.”
With $10 million in financing from a slew of investors including Upfront Ventures, Alpha Edison, the general partners and founders of True Ventures, and a Korean family office, Share Ventures will look to launch between two and four companies per year.
Watt says that the new studio will focus on what he calls “human performance”. The businesses will use a blend of technology and human interaction to create services targeting fitness, nutrition, and mental health, according to Watt.
Share Ventures’ initial focus will be on two main areas, the future of living and the future of working. Within those two areas, the company will focus on developing businesses that enable the development of individual purpose, mental and physical enhancement, and personal and professional growth, according to Watt. And

For Watt, the studio model represents the next iteration of startup investing. “We think the studio is going to lead the way,” he says.
Rather than invest in companies and management teams that are unknown quantities, Watt thinks the studio will be able to create discrete companies much faster in the same way that companies today iterate on new products and services.
“We have aggregated tools into a company building stack,” says Watt. “These are tools that are usable that third parties have developed and internal tool stacks.”
Image Credit: Share Ventures
Watt says Share Ventures will operate as a holding company with pooled equity shared across the employees at the company. “As we work on portfolio companies and build out dedicated teams, there’s a generous pool to incentivize talent.”
In some ways, the model isn’t that different from Bill Gross’ idealab, the Pasadena, Calif.-based incubator company that’s a few miles up the road from Share Ventures Los Angeles home base. Another inspiration is @Ventures, the dot-com era company that built a number of different portfolio companies. “Our investors are getting founders takes in all the companies that we build,” Watt says.
The company has ten people on staff to help build its first slate of companies.
Watt began talking to investors in 2018 about the idea and spent the bulk of 2019 trying to build out its first few companies.
“We run a lot of experiments, we generate a lot of ideas,” Watt says. “The number of shots on goal that we’re taking before we launch a company is significant.”

Amazon Backs Share Ventures, Techstars To Open VC Access



Amazon, which has significant operations in the Los Angeles area, is putting some capital to work in at least two, Los Angeles area venture capital investors, as part of a new fund to back underrepresented entrepreneurs. Amazon said this week that it will invest $150M in venture fund that provide underrepresented entrepreneurs access to capital. The initial investments by Amazon include Los Angeles-based Share Ventures, and Techstars, the venture accelerator/investors which has been extremely active in running programs in the LA area. Amazon says the investments are part of a new effort called Amazon Catalytic Capital, which focuses on backing funds at the pre-seed/seed stage of venture capital, and specifically looking at funds supporting entrepreneurs who are Black, Latino, Indigenous, women, and LGBTQIA+. Amazon says it expects to support more than 10 funds as part of the effort.

“Leadership is the art of giving people a platform for spreading ideas that work.” - Seth Godin
The Internet is truly a wonderful place. It helps us spread ideas, inventions, and call-to-action banners across the globe. This elevated way of communicating helps us get the conversation going in all kinds of fields, especially those concerning the quality of our day-to-day lives.
Therefore, each idea shared as a thought or message can undoubtedly become a reality with the right circle of people supporting it. To aid in this cause, Hamet Watt founded Share Ventures in 2019. The company’s mission is to accelerate the success rate of tech startups that aim to make a change in the world.
But how did the child of a fugitive from Senegal become the modern society’s influencing tycoon in social media and SaaS software technologies?
Who Is Hamet Watt?
Those familiar with the many new-age moguls, founders, and investors have probably heard of Hamet Watt. Hamet is a business owner that kick started his own venture in 2019 after having studied the field for many years.
Though Hamet has been a power player on the Washington tech scene for the past decade, he was not born in wealth. His father was an African fugitive from Senegal who had studied engineering and pushed his two sons to follow in his steps.
Being around tech gadgets all his life, Hamet didn’t end up following the exact pathway of his father. Instead, combining his roots, history, and the perspectives given to him by American society - he decided to make a much louder impact.
Hamet graduated with an engineering degree from the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. However, even this couldn’t motivate him to focus on his dad’s field of passion alone.
In fact, Hamet was born to be an investor, even in the early days of his career. He was much more of an entrepreneur and expert for managing business and capital than an engineer.
Combining both, he started “traveling” the world of start-ups and entrepreneurship, positively connecting people and ideas together. His best trait is his ability to recognize ideas with great potential in the tech industry.
Early Career Start
Even in his earliest career days, Hamet’s talent was undisputed. He was an advisor at Nielsen Media Research and helped them place their first cable TV on the marketplace.
His African roots pushed him to play the role of a General Partner in the New Africa Opportunity Fund, which was the first of its kind for post-apartheid funds in South Africa. Alongside Sloan Financial Group, he helped collect more than $120 million for the South African Opportunity Fund.
Hamet’s aspirations eventually led him to the doorstep of his first company, NextMedium, which re-imagined popular marketing and advertising ideas. Founded in 2004, the company had stellar success for 3 years. After that, Hamet thought it would be best to sell it to  Newport Coast Investments in 2007 and make the big bucks.
After exiting his own company, Hamet found himself employed at Brand Affinity Technologies, where he became Entrepreneur-In-Residence at True Ventures.
In 2011, he co-founded MoviePass along with Stacey Spikes. This is an app that makes users money by letting them watch movies and shows. The money can be later spent at selected venues, like kiosks and theaters.
Hamet also founded a wellness company called bLife, which was acquired by Canary Health in 2015.
As we may conclude, Hamet is a pro at investing. He starts up businesses and then sells them for a lot of money, further branching out and investing more and more. And that’s when the idea for Share Ventures was born.
What Is the Venture Studio Model?
Before we dive more into Share Ventures, let’s discuss the business model it’s based on in a few sentences.
Venture investments or venture companies are the new-era investment funds that bring forth sustainability, equity, and equality in the world of innovation and business.
Venture studios lower the risk of financing a start-up by enabling multiple and efficient solutions, interconnecting dozens of backup solutions. They have a pre-built network of partners and investors, which can be either individual investors or further potential board members of the company they invest in.
Though the first American private venture equity companies are considered to have emerged in the post-war period in 1946 -  American Research and Development Corporation. (ARDC) and J.H. Whitney & Company - the concept of venture capitalism in start-ups is a totally different branch born in the new millennia.
Launching Share Ventures
Before Share Ventures, Hamet tried to reinvent many branches of modern society. Eventually, he came to the idea of transforming one business model in particular - the venture studio business model.
Thus, Hamet founded Share Ventures in 2019, with headquarters in Los Angeles, California. The company was founded with a single and unique venture fund called Share Foundry I. The single-round venture raised $15 million back in March 2019.
Share Ventures offers efficient and sustainable assistance and a set of tools for building start-ups and scaling the venture business further. The SV studio’s team empowers further growth by providing business ideas and entire business concepts, focusing on every aspect from their development to actual realization.
Aside from venture funding, the company enables seed funding models and has a rich portfolio of strategic investment partners for different niches. The continuously-growing investor’s network acts as a stepping stone and force multiplier for many different business models.
Numerous influencers, individual investors, and business owners have used Share Ventures to scale their companies and remain the single founders and CEOs within their own businesses.
Share Ventures Aids Entrepreneurs in Leading Business Models
Some people still don’t even have a clear image of what entrepreneurship is or find it difficult to achieve the title of entrepreneur. Well, Hamet has managed to build a leading funding company catering specifically to this demographic on a global level.
Indeed, his idealism and concept of making ideas happen are truly unique.
Hamet focuses on all aspects - from available funds to actual tools and machinery, but mostly - the never-ending network of potential opportunities made available by the Internet.
And as an aspiring innovator, entrepreneur, and investor, Hamet still has a long way to go. He is just becoming popular for inspirational and motivational podcast episodes and guesting talk shows, aside from his busy everyday business meetings for potential fresh ideas.
Share Ventures Financials
Share Ventures is a venture capital firm, meaning it raises funds to aid aspiring business owners. So far, it’s had one venture fund, which accumulated $15M in March 2019.
It’s unclear whether there’ll be more than a single venture fund, as the owner of Share Ventures hasn’t disclosed such info to the public. However, it’s safe to say that future venture funds are vital for helping Share Ventures’ clients grow.
In short - we’ll likely see another venture fund soon.
Where Does Hamet Watt See Share Ventures in the Future?
Despite clearly focusing on his latest company, Share Ventures, Hamet hasn’t cut all his previous connections.
He manages to be the CEO of Share Ventures while serving as a Board Partner at UpFront Ventures. He is also a Senior Advisor at the Boston-based Consulting Group, Digital Ventures.
It’s safe to say that despite all his successes, Hamet likely has more tricks up his sleeve. His main goal is to further aid the growth of smaller companies with unique ideas and change the world for the better!© Copyrights Growfers 2023

No items found.The Makings of a Mogul MillennialEverything begins with an idea.What do you do when you have a crazy idea? You either go for that lightbulb or you leave it be. But it will always remain an idea without effort. A vision without actions is worthless.Your idea might seem impossible or wild, but it is where progress and innovation happen. Ideas are critical to modern futures.“The day before something is truly a breakthrough, it’s a crazy idea.”– Peter H. DiamandisThis is what Hamet Watt exactly did–making ideas into actions.Watt shared,How did Hamet Watt become resilient, and how did he get it done?The Life of Hamet WattWatt’s Family RootsHamet Watt’s father, who immigrated from Senegal, is an engineer and had a more traditional life path. Watt’s father encouraged his children, Hamet and his brother, to try many things, and this is where Hamet’s inspiration is to do the unusual, the different, the odd.Senegal is located at the westernmost tip of Africa and has abundant air and maritime routes, making it the Gateway to Africa.The country sits at an ecological convergence of semiarid grasslands, oceanfronts, and tropical rainforests; this diverse environment has allowed the country to produce a great variety of animals and plants.A rich natural heritage led to the country’s selection of national symbols–baobabs and lions.Having commendable parents, Hamet gives his utmost respect to them and has made it a mindset to make an impact.The creation of this impact started when he finished his education.Watt’s EducationHamet Watt is a Washington DC native-born from an African immigrant root. Like other people, Hamet had a normal childhood until he was pointed toward something different but greater.Hamet Watt graduated from Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University. Early in his career, Watt encountered the venture capital world and the process of building companies.Early Career of Hamet WattWatt’s First Job VenturesHamet Watt began his career as an investment banker working with emerging technology companies.Following that, Hamet is slowly getting into the industry. Hamet Watts joined a venture capital firm that raised $120 million to invest in companies in Sub-Saharan Africa.With his many entrepreneurship talents, Watts was an adviser to Nielsen Media Research when it developed its first product placement measurement service for network and cable television.With Hamet’s unorthodox career building, his accomplishments slowly aligned as he ventured deeper into start-up businesses. He then founded NextMedium.The NextMedium company, which provided a platform for advertisers to insert their brands into TV shows, movies, and web videos, has sold its technology and other intellectual property to Newport Coast Investments.The company was sold to Newport Coast Investments in 2007 after two rounds of venture capital with Ascend Venture Group, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Globespan Capital Partners.After exiting a company that he founded, it was acquired by Brand Affinity Technologies. Hamet Watt then became an Entrepreneur-In-Residence at True Ventures.Just as things were getting suitable for Hamet, things could still get better.Upfront and Share VenturesUpfront Ventures currently has Hamet Watt as a Venture Partner. Upfront Ventures is a venture capital firm that invests in start-up companies.Watt has been a partner and board member of Upfront Ventures, and he now joins Share Ventures, a start-up space he founded. What is Share Ventures?As a venture studio firm, Share offers startup creation services from the ground up by curating the initial team, guiding the strategic direction, and providing the capital to help startups reach product-market fit and become venture scalable companies.He didn’t limit himself to tech ventures but reinvented NextMedium into another creative business that he can connect to consumers by re-entering the film business.Other Ventures of WattIn 2011, technology and entertainment entrepreneurs Stacy Spikes and Hamet Watt launched MoviePass.How does MoviePass work, and how does MoviePass make money? When a user selects a movie and viewing time on the mobile app, funds can be used at the kiosk. Members were informed the card would function at all major cinemas, but AMC and other movie companies declined to participate.In 2019, subscribers filed a lawsuit accusing MoviePass of being a bait and switch scam. MoviePass data breach has also pushed the FTC to investigate and sued the executives of the now-defunct MoviePass app for defrauding users by preventing them from utilizing the service as claimed while failing to protect their privacy.So what happened to MoviePass? Last year, the MoviePass lawsuit class-action was resolved and agreed to pay $8.25 million launched by investors.Many significant investors backed the project, including True Ventures, AOL Ventures, Lambert Media, Moxie Pictures, etc.Mogul MillennialLooking back at his start-ups gives Hamet Watt a sense of pride from where he made ideas into action.What makes Watt a Mogul Millennial?Watt is quite interested in both the significant and micro aspects of innovation. We are genuinely passionate about solving challenges that we need to tackle (the macro) and the processes, people, tools, and technology that help us become world-class innovators (the micro). Hamet Watt is being described in today’s generation as a Mogul Millennial because he has this attitude and desire to put everything together to create true innovation.What did Stacy Spikes and Hamet Watt learn from entering a market as the underdog when launching MoviePass?Hamet Watt shared to Mogul Millennial what he learned from entering a market as the underdog. His experience with MoviePass proved their capabilities that they were the disruptor in the market and multi-billion dollar companies.Anyone considering creating a subscription business should remember that it is all about the data and the infrastructure you have in place.You need to understand your client acquisition costs, analyze usage, and have a data-driven strategy to develop your business model, especially when dealing with low-margin prospects like the film business.Hamet Watt’s Philosophy on Building a Scalable CompanyThink like an Entrepreneur. Hamet Watt shared his philosophy and how to identify a few pointers to think like a venturing entrepreneur.Watt’s philosophy has always been to pick a large and scalable market when building a company. MoviePass checked that box since many people were going to the movies. The next step would be to find a problem in the market to solve. As movie prices rapidly changed and moviegoing experiences became increasingly expensive, consumers were becoming increasingly frustrated with the movie industry at the time. Due to these frustrations, people were less likely to go to the movies, resulting in a less favorable outcome for the industry. ‍Eventually, people became less interested in watching movies.Hamet Watt’s Greatest Lessons in EntrepreneurshipFocus on the right things as soon as possible. This may seem obvious, but it's easier said than done. Prioritizing is key to achieving success. When it comes to your business, it's essential to know where to spend your time and what counts when trying to create the most value for your company. You can lose your focus if you get around many people and hear a lot of advice about what you're building. It's essential to prioritize and focus on what matters most.What contributed to Watt’s success as an entrepreneur, board member, and investor?Hamet Watt’s success may be credited to selecting large enough markets that correspond closely with Watt’s interests and the connection in those ecosystems.Hamet concentrates on large market prospects. Being in the business long enough, Hamet usually warns individuals that the market they're entering should be large enough because entrepreneurship is difficult.You want to make sure the pot of gold at the end of the business journey is large enough to make all of your hard work worthwhile. Watt’s experiences with his Share Ventures and MoviePass timeline, made him realize this. The goal is to make sure that the monetary rewards are worth it but that there are also additional advantages.Recognitions of Hamet WattWatt’s Awards and HonorsHamet Watts is regarded as a leader in the Los Angeles entrepreneurial community and beyond. He was named one of Business Insider's 46 Most Important African-Americans in Technology for 2014.Like fellow XPRIZE honoree, Anita Schjøll Brede, Watt received the Top 10 Black Innovators Award for his tech innovation and entrepreneurship work.In the national press, Hamet Watt has been credited for innovations in media and entrepreneurship and like Yousef Abuzuaiter, Watt has been featured in publications including:ForbesEntrepreneurThe Wall Street JournalThe Los Angeles TimesPersonal Life of Hamet WattHamet Watt is married to his wife, Joy, and the couple is enjoying family life with their son, Zion. Hamet Watt and his family currently live in Los Angeles.Currently, Watt serves on the Los Angeles Venture Association board and is involved with several other entrepreneurial organizations. Hamet Watt is excited to explore continually and looks ahead, “I think we're in a very interesting time for innovation. I'm excited about new ways of coming up with solutions to problems, and new design & funding frameworks for building companies. It takes a lot less money now to get at the essence of what solves a problem so that means we can really reimagine the whole entrepreneurial stack. So I'm really excited about that.”Key Takeaway: Hamet WattWhen an idea comes to our mind, we can get enthusiastic about materializing it. But like everything else, entrepreneurship has its set of challenges and struggles.Like Mark Pincus, Neha Narkhede, and Zeb Evans, these other entrepreneurs and modern founders had their set of challenges and broke through.It is impossible not to be able to face difficulties. It is within Hamet Watt’s challenges that he has formulated his philosophy on building a scalable company. He had situations where he saw dead ends in his ventures but fortunately turned out okay.As for Hamet Watt, “I think being able to find your way out of situations that you think are impossible is what inspires you to take bigger risks knowing that you're gonna get out if it happens again.”When we get to a place where we think there’s no way out and there’s no successful path, keep going.“I remind myself, in all circumstances and conditions, that I am a resilient person and I will get it done..”  - Hamet Watt.We can imitate Hamet Watts as persistent and resilient as primary characteristics for success.

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced Amazon Catalytic Capital, a new initiative to invest $150 million in venture capital (VC) funds, accelerators, incubators, and venture studios that provide funding to entrepreneurs from underrepresented backgrounds, primarily at the pre-seed/seed stage of venture capital funding. The company will invest in funds that focus on Black, Latino, Indigenous, women, and LGBTQIA+ founders. Amazon expects to support more than 10 funds and over 200 companies through the next year.



“We’ve seen incredibly innovative ideas from underrepresented entrepreneurs—from companies offering inclusive health services for women, to startups helping companies mitigate climate impact for underserved communities—and we’re convinced that an inclusive investment strategy leads to better returns and innovation. We want to ensure that these companies and their founders have the same access to capital as anyone else,” said Peter Krawiec, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide corporate development. “We hope that our investment will be catalytic—sparking a force-multiplying effect by inspiring others to invest in these companies, fostering inclusion and innovation, positively impacting communities, and creating generational wealth and financial return.”

In addition to capital, the companies in the funds’ portfolios will receive mentorship from Amazon executives and gain access to resources to support their business and technical strategy. Amazon teams will also work with the startups to identify partnership and product collaboration opportunities that could accelerate their growth.

Historically, underrepresented founders have had less access to startup venture capital and greater difficulties in securing funding to bring ideas to fruition. Studies consistently show that Black, Latino, women, and LGBTQIA+ startup founders are underrepresented across the total number of funded startups. According to PitchBook, women founders received 2% of U.S. venture capital funding in 2021. Similarly, Black-founded and Latino-founded startups attracted only 1% and 2% of U.S. venture capital funding respectively last year as reported by Crunchbase News. Research shows that these inequities create a negative ripple effect for underrepresented entrepreneurs, including reduced access to networks, mentors, and sponsors. Despite these challenges, diverse and inclusive teams are 75% more likely to see ideas become products and 70% more likely to serve new categories.

Through this initiative, Amazon has invested in the following funds:


Collide Capital — Collide Capital is a Black-owned seed and pre-seed venture capital fund led by two founders under the age of 35: Aaron Samuels, who co-founded AfroTech, and Brian Hollins, who is a founding Board Member of BLCK VC. To date, Collide Capital has backed over 40 companies, of which 80%+ are led by Black, Latino, and/or female founders.


Elevate Future Fund — Elevate Future Fund, which is overseen by Energy Impact Partners (EIP), focuses on increasing funding to underrepresented founders working on solutions to accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and clean energy future. It will also make investments in companies that are led by underrepresented entrepreneurs, are empowering diverse talent, and/or are creating economic opportunity for distressed or disadvantaged communities. Elevate will also collaborate closely with Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, which invests in emerging climate technology companies.


Share Ventures — Share Ventures is a Los Angeles-based venture fund and venture foundry focused on human performance. Share focuses on solving problems by creating and investing in innovative companies that unlock human potential, in categories including health tech, future of work, people tech, fintech, transportation, and purpose tech (companies facilitating impact and change).


Techstars Rising Stars Fund — With its first investments in 2022, the Rising Stars Fund is a pre-seed venture capital fund investing in underrepresented founders of color in the U.S. The fund is part of the Techstars investment business that provides access to capital, one-on-one mentorship, and customized programming for early-stage entrepreneurs.


Investors from the VC funds supported by Amazon have supported hundreds of underrepresented startup founders. With Amazon’s investments, these VC funds expect to back hundreds more companies and, in turn, help create more jobs and unlock economic growth in historically underserved communities.

“We are focused on addressing financial inclusion across the globe, and Collide Capital has been an investor in us from the early days. Collide has helped us to shape our vision and opened up access to future rounds of funding,” said the founder and CEO of fintech startup EMTECH, Carmelle Cadet. “EMTECH discovered a unique value proposition in rebuilding central banking infrastructure for the Web3 era. As a Black woman-founded tech company, having Collide getting excited about our vision was critical to our journey. We are better with them as partners, and I am excited to see how Amazon is supporting them to help even more entrepreneurs like me.”

“Our collaboration with the team at Amazon was born out of our shared passion for innovation in key areas that improve the human experience at scale. We are aligned with Amazon’s customer obsession and grateful to be learning and collaborating with them to build a portfolio of game changing companies,” said Hamet Watt, managing partner at Share Ventures.

Amazon Catalytic Capital is the latest in a series of Amazon-sponsored initiatives to boost and support early stage, underrepresented entrepreneurs. Amazon Web Services recently launched the AWS Impact Accelerator, investing $30 million in a series of programs designed to help high-potential, pre-seed startups led by underrepresented founders succeed. Amazon chose North American startups to be part of its 2022 Black Founders Build with Alexa cohort, each receiving a $100,000 Alexa Fund investment, as well as technology support. Additionally, in 2021, Amazon committed $150 million to its Black Business Accelerator, an initiative to help Black business owners succeed as sellers in Amazon’s stores.

Share Ventures, an LA-based studio for company creation



Industry News



Aug 8

Written By Jessica Barnette





On August 8, 2020, it was announced that serial entrepreneur and startup investor, Hamet Watt, was combining his two career paths (MoviePass, True Ventures, NextMedium, Upfront Ventures) under the auspices of Share Ventures. With $10 million in financing from a slew of investors including Upfront Ventures,  Alpha Edison, the general partners and founders of True Ventures,  and a Korean family office, Share Ventures will look to launch between two and four companies per year.Watt says that the new studio will focus on what he calls “human performance”. The businesses will use a blend of technology and human interaction to create services targeting fitness, nutrition, and mental health, according to Watt.Share Ventures’ initial focus will be on two main areas, the future of living and the future of working. Within those two areas, the company will focus on developing businesses that enable the development of individual purpose, mental and physical enhancement, and personal and professional growth, according to Watt.You can read the full TechCrunch article here.
